# Team Balancer

An [AMX Mod X](https://www.amxmodx.org/) plugin for [Counter-Strike 1.6](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10/CounterStrike/) that performs static team balancing (i.e., based on a skill rating precomputed upon connection to the server, rather than on frags/deaths accumulated throughout the game). See [ยง Operation](#operation) for details.

## Requirements

- HLDS
- Metamod
- AMX Mod X (>= 1.9.0)

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/prnl0/amxx-team-balancer/releases/latest).
2. Extract the 7z archive into your HLDS folder.
3. Append `team_balancer_core.amxx` and `team_balancer_skill.amxx` to `configs/plugins.ini`.
4. _(Optional)_ Append `team_balancer_info.amxx` and `team_balancer_ui.amxx` to the same file if you need/want the features these sub-plugins offer.

## Operation

When a map is loaded, we wait `tb_delay_before_start` seconds before doing anything. After this delay has elapsed, we check, at the end of each round, whether certain triggers (see [ยง Triggers](#triggers)) were activated (or should be activated, in the case of regular (round-based) triggers). If they have, and if the difference in skill or player count between the two teams is significant (this being defined by `tb_skill_diff_threshold` and `tb_player_count_threshold`, respectively), and both teams have at least 2 players, we attempt to balance them using either one of three balancing strategies (see [ยง Balancing strategies](#balancing-strategies)). _(Note: this, and the delay can be overriden by a forced balancing that has higher precedence and can be invoked by either the server or a player with appropriate access.)_ To do this, we evaluate the result transferring a certain player would yield using three different algorithms (see [ยง Algorithms](#algorithms)) to identify the best candidates for transfer. If any are found, and result in a sufficient skill diff. delta (`tb_skill_min_diff_global_delta`), we perform the transfers; otherwise, we hold that the balancing has failed, and wait for the triggers to be activated again.

The skill rating itself is computed 0.5 s after a client is `putinserver` (though it should probably be computed immediately, without delay). Currently, the function that performs the actual computation ([`compute_skill`](https://github.com/prnl0/amxx-team-balancer/blob/111167f15633da1c9d0cfa24f4fb76d9e9264dbe/cstrike/addons/amxmodx/scripting/team_balancer_skill.sma#L163-L176)) is hardcoded and uses the following formula:
$$0.4k\cdot\frac{\text{kills}}{\text{deaths}} + 0.1k\cdot\frac{\text{headshots}}{\text{kills}} + 0.4\text{prs}\_\text{used} + 0.1\cdot(\text{prs}\_\text{used} - \text{prs}\_\text{bought})\text{,}$$
where $k = 100$ is the scaling factor.

### Triggers

We define three balance check triggers:
- **regular (round-based):** trigger every `tb_rounds_between_balancing` rounds;
- **player connection/disconnection:** trigger when a player connects/disconnects;
- **change in skill diff. between teams:** trigger when the skill difference between the two teams changes (checked `tb_skill_recheck_diff_delay` seconds after the last team join event occurs).

There is also a fourth "trigger" type which completely disables automatic balance checks (`tb_balance_check_trigger 0`).

### Balancing strategies

The three balancing strategies include:
- **performance**: start with lowest cost algorithm (simple unidirectional); assume teams are balanced when skill diff. satisfies both `tb_skill_min_diff_global_delta` and `tb_skill_min_desired_diff` (note: this will probably be reconsidered to prioritize min. desired skill diff. over global delta requirement);
- **balanced**: start with medium cost algorithm (chain-evaluated unidirectional); assume teams are balanced under the same conditions as _performance_ strategy;
- **best difference**: exhaust all algorithms to find the best skill difference that satisfies both `tb_skill_min_diff_global_delta` and `tb_skill_min_desired_diff` (see note in _performance_ strategy description, above).

### Algorithms

The three algorithms for identifying the best candidates for transfer include:
- **simple unidirectional**:  iterate over stronger team players, identifying ones that would yield lowest diff. in skill between the two teams; stop when either `tb_player_count_threshold` or `tb_max_transfers_per_team` is reached, subsequent transfers do not yield a sufficient change in skill diff. (i.e., do not satisfy `tb_skill_min_diff_local_delta`), or `tb_skill_min_desired_diff` is satisfied and balancing strategy is either _performance_ or _balanced_. This algorithm is not context-aware, meaning it does not base its' picks on the skill rating of other players within the team; therefore it does not always make the best decisions.
- **chain-evaluated unidirectional**: similar to _simple unidirectional_, although now context-aware: evaluate all possible sequences/chains of transfers (up to length $n = \($`tb_player_count_threshold` + $(\text{pnum}\_\text{str} - \text{pnum}\_\text{wkr}))/2$) to find the one that would yield the lowest diff. in skill between the two teams. Performs either equivalently as or better than _simple unidirectional_;
- **switch**: find switches that would yield lowest diff. in skill between the two teams; stop when `tb_max_transfers_per_team` is reached, subsequent switches do not yield a sufficient change in skill diff. (i.e., do not satisfy `tb_skill_min_diff_local_delta`), or `tb_skill_min_desired_diff` is satisfied and balancing strategy is either _performance_ or _balanced_. Usually performs best but is typically most costly.
